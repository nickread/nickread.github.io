<p>SPAs have come a long way over the last decade (I'm looking at you Outlook Web Access), and are almost unavoidable these days with many major websites being implemented as one. I always assumed writing a large SPA would be impossible due to complexity, cross-browser issues and the inability to easily do unit testing. Without actually attempting to do so, I presumed that the requried effort for writing everything client-side would be, say, twice as great as writing an AJAX heavy server-client application. Thankfully that assumption is turning out to be quite wrong, in fact, I'm slowly becoming of the opinion that SPAs are actually easier, for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A big part of writing large, Ajax heavy web applications is ensuring all the necessary state is transferred back and forth to the server. Forget to post back one of the form elements and the server response is going to be incorrect. The product I work on also had a lot of contextal modification which exacerbates this issue; for example, a search page that worked as expected, except when used in another context at which point several other hidden fields had to be submitted for all AJAX calls to, which in turn could impact the search results being returned. In this case, you don't know what you needs to be submitted, so you just have to submit everything.  Thankfully we wrote a framework for generating the correct Javascript and for performing all AJAX calls, but it's still a big effort. This sort of problem can still exist in a SPA, but the context handling is done along on the browser side which should make things easier.</p></li>
<li><p>It greatly simplies the server-side because all you need to worry about now is providing an API. Not only is this much more easily testable than a UI (see <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>), but your code can be optimised just for API delivery, possibly removing abstractions that were previously necessary for concurrently deliverying a UI. Who these days isn't already providing their consumers with a set of APIs? Writing your UI on top of your own, public APIs is a fantastic way of demonstrating how complete they are. If you decide to take an SPA to its ultimate conclusion where the browser state <em>is</em> the user session and your servers are entirely stateless, you will also see the benefits of code simplification and easy scaling out of your app servers.</p></li>
<li><p>The JS libraries for helping deliver and SPA, MVC(ish) solution are all excellent. Are they perfect? No, not even close. Will they save you time, money and headaches? Absolutely, and they're probably the biggest reason as to why SPAs are more viable to implement than ever before.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="angularjs">AngularJS</h3>

<p>I've been playing around with <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> for about 12 months; first investigating it personally, then as part of my work. I haven't really looked at other libraries (like <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>) yet, but it does seem like AngularJS has all the momentum right now.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the learning curve is really high due to the poor documentation at the time I was learning. They've been doing great work to fix this, but it's still not there yet - I still need to go to StackOverflow for some answers, especially wondering what the 'best' way to do something is - the AngularJS doco still has a habit of layouting out all the different ways you could accomplish something which is not ideal in most cases that you're already frustrated trying to accomplish or fix something.</p>

<p>I really love using the <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router">AngularUI Router</a> module as it provides much greater flexibility around nested views; however, it looks like I should be writing a lot more stuff as Directives instead. They seem a bit clunky sometimes, but they're clearly the best way to writing components that are reusable and individually testable. Once you've got a bunch of reusable directives, maybe the need for implementing the app as nested <code>ui-view</code>s goes away.  </p>

<h3 id="problemswithangularjsorjavascript">Problems with AngularJS... or Javascript?</h3>

<p>So I still have problems when I'm developing AngularJS apps - I feel like I'm in a constant cycle of refreshing, clearing the cache and checking the console. I come from a land of strongly typed language though with IDEs that point out issues immediately, so maybe it's just my skills getting weak at writing code correctly in the first place. I've lost count of the number of times I've missed a comma, or that I'm too scared to refactor with any sort of confidence (thanks again though Git), but these aren't AngularJS problems - they're Javascript problems (or my problems writing Javascript!). I feel the same way when I've tried writing any sort of reasonable sized Node.js project before too.</p>

<p>I think the solution to this is <a href="adart">AngularDart</a>. I haven't had a need to use Dart yet, but it certainly looks like a great alternative. I'm most interested though that they haven't tried to simply "use AngularJS" but in Dart, which is how you use it with <a href="http://alxhill.com/blog/articles/angular-coffeescript/">CoffeeScript</a>, but they're rewriting it as if it were a native Dart library.</p>

<p>Something to keep my eye on anyway. </p>
